# 📝 Notes Manager Project

## 📊 Analysis of Existing Technologies + Comparison
In building this project, various technologies were considered:

- **Node.js + Express.js** 🚀 - A lightweight and efficient backend framework for handling API requests.
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** 🗄️ - A NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability for storing notes.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** 🔐 - Used for secure authentication and session management.
- **Bcrypt.js** 🔑 - Ensures password security by hashing user credentials.

### 🔍 Comparison:
| Technology | Pros ✅ | Cons ❌ |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Node.js + Express.js** | Fast, lightweight, easy to scale | Callback hell (if not handled well) |
| **MongoDB + Mongoose** | Flexible schema, high availability | No strict ACID compliance |
| **JWT Authentication** | Stateless, scalable | Security risks if tokens are not managed well |

## 🏛️ Project Architecture
The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture** to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

📌 **Model (Mongoose Schemas)** - Defines the structure of Users and Notes.
📌 **View (Frontend)** - HTML & JavaScript used for user interaction.
📌 **Controller (Express Controllers)** - Handles logic, authentication, and database queries.

Additionally, **RESTful API principles** were followed to make the project scalable and maintainable. 

🛠️ **Key Components:**
- `models/` - MongoDB models for Users & Notes
- `controllers/` - Handles request logic
- `routes/` - Defines API endpoints
- `middleware/` - Authentication middleware
- `config/` - Database connection

## 🌍 Relevance of the Work / Practical Significance

- **Digital Note-Taking** 📖 - Helps users store, retrieve, and organize their thoughts.
- **Secure User Authentication** 🔒 - Ensures only authorized users can access their data.
- **Scalability** 📈 - The project is built using modern web technologies that can handle a growing user base.
- **API-First Approach** 🔗 - Can be integrated with mobile or other web apps.

## 📌 Methodology of the Work

### 1️⃣ **Project Planning** 📜
- Identified core requirements: user authentication, CRUD operations for notes, security measures.
- Created mockups and data models.

### 2️⃣ **Technology Selection** ⚙️
- Chose **Node.js + Express** for backend due to its non-blocking architecture.
- Used **MongoDB** for flexible data storage.

### 3️⃣ **Implementation** 🏗️
- Developed authentication system with **JWT & bcrypt**.
- Implemented API endpoints with Express.js.
- Connected frontend with API using JavaScript.

### 4️⃣ **Testing & Optimization** 🔄
- Tested API endpoints using **Postman**.
- Used **Benchmark.js** for performance testing.

## 🎨 Mockups & Design
A visual representation of the **Notes App UI & API workflow**:

📌 **Mockup Features:**
- Simple and intuitive design for note creation & management.
- Login & registration pages.
- Dashboard to view and manage notes.

*(Include wireframes or screenshots here if available)*
